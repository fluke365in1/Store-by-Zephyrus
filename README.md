### Shop and store for Sourcemod

From the previous time the plugin is uncompileable on the latest stable sourcemod version. (SM 1.10) to fix this problem I have to rename all variable that might duplicate with the one that already existed. it's only take me a few day to do it. You might find the warning showing up.

I recommand you to get all latest version of includes files by yourself first. because it has been outdated at least 4 years. but I might just put it later
